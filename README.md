##Ollie Controller

##Important

* ~~You need to [rebuild](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/build-native-modules-with-nw-gyp) bluetooth-hci-socket module in noble module in olliejs module for this module to work.~~
* ~~To run without sudo (I haven't tested this on other distros or Mac or Windows) you have to enter the following command in ~/.nwjs after nwjs creates .nwjs directory.~~
~~CODE DELETED~~

* ~~Running without sudo is highly encouraged, otherwise you may face unwanted folders in your project folder.~~
* Ubuntu users shouldn't have to do anything now, I haven't written ~~Mac and ~~Windows script~~s~~ yet, will write ~~them~~ it when I have time.
* After you clone the repo/get the repo from npm to a folder and run ```FIRSTRUN.sh``` first, then you can use```init.sh```.

##Installing

* Clone this repository or ```npm install ollie-controller``` in a folder.
* ~~Rebuild hci-socket or the alternative for your distro (OS) [for windows it is bluetooth-hci-socket] with nw-gyp.~~
* ~~[Optional] grant bluetooth access to ```nw``` in ```~/.nwjs``` directory to use without sudo.||
* ```FIRSTRUN.sh```
